# Plot-and-Nav-a-Virtual-Maze
## Udacity Capstone Projects: Plot and Navigate a Virtual Maze

## How to run the code
In order to run the tester.py script, type the following command in the terminal:

```
python tester.py test_maze_01.txt ff no
```

There are five arguments. 

* The first one is ``python`` command. 
* The second one is the ``tester.py`` script. 
* The third one is the file name of the maze we want to test. There are three maze provided by Udacity, which are ``test_maze_01.txt``, ``test_maze_02.txt``, and ``test_maze_03.txt``. Later, I will add another test maze ``test_maze_04.txt`` which is generated by myself. 
* The fourth argument is the algorithm we want to use. There are three algorithms can be chosen: ``rf`` stands for the Right-First algorithm; ``nf`` stands for the New-First Algorithm; ``ff`` stands for the Flood-Fill algorithm. 
* The fifth argument can be ``yes`` or ``no``, which indicate whether the robot is set to keep exploring new cells after reaching the center and on the way back to the origin. 


### Implementation

The implementation consists of four different classes: algorithms, cell, robot, training. 

* Algorithms: has the logic that enables the robot to decide how to move.
* Cell: represents a square cell in the maze.
* Training: representation of the maze from the robotâ€™s view.
* Robot: control the robot to move around the maze.


#### Requirements

Python 2.7.X

Numpy
